## Available Secret Types

- **Password :** Passwords are used for user authentication purposes. They grant access to protected systems, databases, or applications.
- **Token :** Tokens are short-lived pieces of data used for authentication or authorization. They often act as temporary credentials for accessing resources.
- **API Key :** API keys are unique identifiers used to authenticate applications or users when interacting with APIs.
- **Basic Auth :** Basic authentication is a simple authorization scheme that transmits credentials (username and password) directly within the request header.
